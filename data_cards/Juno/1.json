        "You can always count on Jus Ed to bring the no-nonsense approach to house music to its logical conclusion, and so it is on his latest release, which extends some love to an undisclosed acquaintance. The first version features Alison Crockett crooning over the whimsical piano chords and direct drum programming you would expect from the Underground Quality label boss, while the second version switches the feminine delivery for Jaymz Nylon's baritone interpretation.

Rounding out the EP Ed drops a dubbed out \"Gratitude\" mix that draws on his greatest deep house strengths for a more developed trip through both vocal contributions."
