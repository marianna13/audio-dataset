## Preprocessing Principles

You may refer to [preprocess_fma.py](/data_preprocess/preprocess_fma.py) for all the details. Here is a concise summary:

We retrieve information
from the meta data (fma_metadata/tracks.csv) and form a 3-field `.json` file for each audio. Here are some audio-json pairs selected from the processed dataset:


#### 
<audio id="audio" controls="controls" preload="yes">
      <source id="flac" src="1.flac">
</audio><br>

```json
{
    "text": [
        "playing song in album The Phantasmal Farm, titled When The Robo B-boys Just Kill It, by The Polish Ambassador, of which the genre is Electronic, the date created is 2014-02-12 17:38:32, the language code is nan"

### I. Json file generation principles 
-  **` text  entry`** We create two dictinaries song_info and extra_info. For song info we use fields like album, from which we construct a string like `in album {album}`, for title - `titled {title}`, for artist - `by {artist}`. In extra info we include genre with sitring like `the genre is {genre}`, date of creation (`the date created is {date_recorded}`), language code of a song - `the language code is {language_code}`, for composer - `the composer is {composer}` (in case some of attributes don't exist for a particular audio, we just don't include it). Then we randomly shuffle both song_info and extra_info and join each of the lists into a string. After that we create a following template `playing song {song_info}, of which {extra_info}`.
-  **` tag  entry`** We use the song title and the genre of a song for each audio as a tag.
-  **` original data`** We save filename, genre, album, date created, composer, language code, duration of audio, the dataset name and dataset description.

### II. Audio filtering principles
1. Keep audios with sampling rate higher than **16KHZ** and discard the rest.
2. Discard all audios failed to be read by `soundfile.read()` method or denied by FFmpeg while processing.
3. Split every audio in 10 sec segements.
### III. Audio format specifications
After the preprocessing work, all audio files should be in FLAC format with sampling rate of 48KHZ. (Processed by ffmpeg).
